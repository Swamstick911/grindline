Why I Made This
I was behind in school and needed more than just a list of things to do.
I wanted:

A way to keep track of how hard I work every day

Tools to help me plan my studies around my classes and coaching

A dashboard that keeps me on track

That's why I made Grindline, my "comeback planner."
